## Abstract

Meeting climate targets requires profound transformations in the energy system. Most energy uses should be electrified, but where this is not feasible, hydrogen can be part of the solution. However, 98% of global hydrogen production involves greenhouse gas emissions, with an average of 12 kg CO2e / kg H2. Therefore, new hydrogen production pathways are needed in order to make hydrogen production compatible with climate targets. Although both onshore and offshore production pathways have been suggested, the comparative impacts on energy use and emissions intensity are unclear. In this work, we fill this gap by systematically comparing the energy and emissions intensity of hydrogen production pathways suitable for the UK. 173 unique production pathways were identified and modelled, spanning onshore and offshore production, various offshore transmission methods, and the use of repurposed infrastructure. The results show that it is unlikely that any fossil fuel-based pathways could meet the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard. However, electrolytic hydrogen powered by fixed offshore wind could align with this standard, either onshore or offshore. The results also suggest that embodied carbon of hydrogen infrastructure and fugitive emissions can significantly influence the intensity of green hydrogen, leading to between 10-50% of emissions.
